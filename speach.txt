Hello, the topic of my speach is "Availability of firearms in diffrent countries.".


1. Some parts of USA are the most known example of a region with no limitations
   (other than age requirements) when it comes to buying and owning firearms.  
2. In UK the rules are different. You can be as young as 14 yo and if you have a certificate you
   can own and use a rifle/shotgun.
3. But, handguns were complitelly banned after Dunblane massacre in 1996 which killed 16 students and a teacher.
   Such shootings happen ocassionally in the US but the law isn't being changed.
4. The current situation in Poland (and most countries in the world) is more reasonable than in USA or even (in my opinion) in the UK.
   The rules are simply:
	- you have to be over 21 yo,
	- you need to be approved by doctors about your physical and mental capability,
	- you can't be addicted to any substance,
	- you can't have ever commited any crime,
	- give a valid explanation to why you need the weapon.
5. Of course there are ways of getting a firearm illegally at any
   age with or without any certificate.
6. In my opinion it is very important to control firearms distribution becouse anyone
   with minimal training can do a serious harm to someone, while using them.
   They are much more dangerous than a knife or peper gas. So while some USA citizens claim
   that the guns are just for personal protection is an overstatement and should not be sold to anyone.
